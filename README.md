# ProteinVisionary: Protein Structure Predictor

Welcome to the ProteinVisionary, powered by ESMFold! This tool utilizes the ESMFold model to predict the 3D structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence.

## Project Description

This project provides a user-friendly web interface for predicting the 3D structure of proteins. Users can enter a protein sequence, initiate the structure prediction, and visualize the predicted structure in 3D.

## Deployed Web App

Access the live version of the Protein Structure Predictor on [Streamlit](https://proteinvisionary-protein-structure-predictor.streamlit.app/)

## How to Use

1. **Enter Protein Sequence:** On the main page, enter the target protein sequence in the provided text area.

2. **Predict Structure:** Click the "Predict" button to initiate the structure prediction.

3. **Visualize and Download:** After prediction, visualize the 3D structure and download the PDB file for further analysis.

## About ESMFold
